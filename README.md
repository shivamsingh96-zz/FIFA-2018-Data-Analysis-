6. As a National coach of France team you want to compare the national team of England, Spain, Italy and Germany to understand the competition. The formation of the teams is restricted to 4-3-3 (4 defenders, 3 midfielders, 3 forwards, 1 Goal Keeper) and players 
with overall value of more than 75 are preferred, now form the best team for each of the mentioned countries and compare them. Note down all the insights that you as a business
